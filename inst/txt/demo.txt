The Bioconductor package \"Voyager\" focuses on facilitating the analysis of spatial single-cell genomics data through implementing methods for exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). Utilizing the newly defined S4 class called SpatialFeatureExperiment (SFE), Voyager caters to a diverse set of analytical needs in spatial omics. Univariate methods, including Moran’s I and permutation testing, allow researchers to examine global spatial patterns. In bivariate analyses, tools such as Lee's L and cross variograms are provided to study relationships between spatial variables. Multivariate approaches include MULTISPATI PCA and local Geary’s C, assisting in revealing complex spatial relationships. Beyond analysis, Voyager offers several plotting functions to visualize both the raw SFE data and the spatial analytical results. Voyager supports users with comprehensive documentation and builds upon dependencies like BiocParallel, ggplot2, SingleCellExperiment, among others, ensuring robust integration into R-based workflows, primarily requiring R version 4.4 or greater. The package is a collective effort curated by several authors, offering resources for both immediate use and further developmental access via its GitHub repository.
